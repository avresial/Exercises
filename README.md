## Courses

### BlazorWebAssemblyYTCourse
My attempt in learning blazor web assembly. Two most important things I learned are
- how to create simple razor components 
- how to retrive data from API

### TestNinja

Inside UnitTestsExcercises directory there is TestNinja solution which contains all my progress in course `Unit Testing for C# Developers` by Mosh Hamedani on Udemy platform. This course covers basics of unit testing. All lectures are done using NUnit but I'm trying to recreate it while using XUnit. All skils I learn there are used in my other projects like [RumikApp](https://github.com/avresial/RumikApp).
